1.	What are the top five daily gainers?
2.	What are the top five daily losers?
3.	What are the top five stocks with the highest trading volume during the trading day?
4.	What are the top five undervalued growth stocks?
5.	What are the top five recently rated stocks that are considered a Strong Buy by analysts?                                                                                 
then used Seaborn to demonstrate the analysis.
